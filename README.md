# Wesfolio Project

## Description
The Wesfolio project is an organizational tool for the projects that I have completed and the projects that I will be working on in the future. I wanted to create this so people could easily access the content that I have created. Creating this I have learned a lot of new techniques to style and make this page look as good as I can make it. While it's not close to perfect, I will continue to update and make changes to get it there.

## usage
To use this page, you may use the navigation bar to go to any section that you are looking for as they are working links to the page. Once work is introduced to the portfolio you may view it by clicking on the icon that is associated with the certain project that you are seeking. My github is linked at the bottom and my email and phone number are listed there as well.
